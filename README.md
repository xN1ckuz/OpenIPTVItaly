## 📡 EPG Source
When available, EPG data is obtained from publicly accessible sources provided by **epgshare01.online**.

The EPG is used for informational purposes only and reflects standard TV scheduling
data that is already publicly available.

This project does not access private APIs, restricted services, or proprietary
broadcast systems.

> Note: The **OpenIPTVItaly_No_EPG** playlist does not rely on any EPG source.

## 🐞 Known Issues and Changelog

The following channels do not currently have an IPTV-compatible stream available and are included **only to preserve correct LCN numbering**:

- **Boing Plus (+1 / Channel 45)** *(LCN-only)*
- **Teledue (Channel 12)** *(LCN-only)*
- **Canale 63 (Channel 63 known as CS24.Live)** *(LCN-only)*

Some streams may appear offline even though the source is still active.

This usually happens because **stream URLs are protected by temporary access tokens** generated by the content provider:

- Tokens are time-limited and expire automatically  
- Direct links stop working once the token becomes invalid  
- A valid token is typically generated only by official websites or players 

As a result, these streams may not function in generic IPTV players.

### Affected / Problematic Channels

The following channels are currently known to use token-based or unstable URLs:

- Alma TV (Channel 65)

All notable changes are documented in **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**.
